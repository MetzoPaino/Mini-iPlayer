In this three-part series, he is travelling way beyond his comfort zone and the world of complimentary breakfast buffets to some of the most unlikely places on earth for a holiday. Hosted by locals and fully immersed in the local culture, Romesh gets an eye-opening, and at times heart-stopping, insider's guide to countries that are big on natural beauty, character and charm.\n\nIn this first episode, Romesh gets an insider's guide to Haiti to find out if his preconceptions about the Caribbean island are right, or if there is more to the country than the sensational headlines he has seen on the news. Everything Romesh has ever heard about Haiti has been negative. They had a dictator who terrorised the island, a 2010 earthquake that crippled the country and then a devastating hurricane. That is all before President Trump called it something unmentionable. But are all the bad news reports fair? Does Haiti deserve its reputation? Haiti is in the middle of the Caribbean, surrounded by Cuba, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. It should be a paradise, so why doesn't anyone go there?\n\nTo find out, Romesh Ranganathan, comedian and coward, is travelling across the Atlantic to spend a week in the country. This isn't his typical holiday destination - Romesh's idea of a perfect holiday is a week in Spain. He avoids 'culture' and he rarely leaves the comfort of the hotel swimming pool. In almost every conceivable way he is the wrong person to send, except one - he is honest. Landing in the Haitian capital Port au Prince, Romesh sets to work getting to grips with a country that - arguably more than any other - has suffered from a bad reputation. Guided by his host - Peabody award-winning journalist Jeremy Dupin - Rom throws himself into Haitian life. It is a chaotic journey that will take him from the iron market to vodou ceremonies, from cathedrals destroyed by the earthquake to the slums.\n\nSo has the world got it wrong about Haiti? Romesh sets off to find out.","small":"Romesh finds out if there is more to Haiti than the sensational headlines on the news.","medium":"Romesh Ranganathan travels to some of the most unlikely places on earth for a holiday.

Paul thought a tour of the country's finest fishing spots might help Bob's recovery, and along the way maybe they would learn something about each other. In this funny and poignant six-part series, we eavesdrop on their expedition as they reconnect with each other and share their personal experiences of life, while testing the parameters of true friendship.\n\nThey also fish, and talk nonsense. A lot.\n\nOn soggy riverbanks, they candidly discuss everything from show business to solitude, relationships and romance, while trying to catch some of the most significant species of fish in the country. This is as much an insight into the hearts and minds of two of the UK's best-loved comics as it is about capturing the extreme exhilaration and occasional monotony of one of the most popular pastimes in the UK.\n\nWhile in Norfolk fishing for tench, Bob tries to impress Paul with his childhood fishing rod - and fails. They share nostalgia for their younger years and reveal how they recently came face to face with their own mortality. After a brief respite in a local brewery, they reluctantly camp down in yurts before fishing again the next day where the elusive tench seems to evade them until the very last minute.","small":"Paul and Bob fish for tench in Norfolk and reminisce about their childhood days.","medium":"Paul Whitehouse and Bob Mortimer tour the country's finest fishing spots and talk a lot of nonsense.

Every year, around 200 people in the UK are convicted of murder. A guilty verdict can only be challenged if new evidence comes to light - and less than one per cent of cases are ever overturned. Inside Justice is a registered charity led by Louise Shorter, supported by a panel of criminal lawyers, ex-police officers and forensics experts who offer assistance in cases where there could have been a miscarriage of justice.\n\nGlyn Razzell was convicted of murdering his wife Linda in 2003. Her body has never been found and Glyn has always protested his innocence. Led by Louise Shorter, Inside Justice experts in forensic science, policing and law re-examine the case to see if there is any new evidence that could challenge the conviction. The key evidence from the trial was that Linda's blood was found in the boot of the car her estranged husband was driving on that day. Experts hear how this blood wasn't found until the third police search of the vehicle. Glyn has always maintained the blood was planted and that Linda's death was staged. Inside Justice blood experts review the original forensic evidence presented at trial to see if they agree with the conclusions that were made 15 years ago. They also apply for forensic material to run new tests which they believe will help them interrogate Glyn Razzell's insistence that the blood was planted to frame him.\n\nA new line of enquiry also came to light in 2016. There is speculation of a link between Linda and a convicted murderer who killed two women in the Swindon area. Could Linda have been another one of his victims?

Many of these cases are avoidable, but sepsis is notoriously difficult to diagnose. It was only through the quick-thinking actions of the NHS staff, and the rapid diagnosis of her blood samples, that Fern survived. She returns to the hospital to meet the surgeon who operated on her and the consultant who diagnosed her, to say thank you and find out more about the condition that nearly killed her.\n\nWhen Fern came in, her samples were sent to the pathology lab for analysis. Fern visits one of the NHS's busiest pathology labs, which processes 70,000 samples a day, to find out how it works and what has changed over the years. \n\nThe NHS has been waging a war against infectious disease since it started 70 years ago, but sophisticated medicine and vaccinations aren't the only weapons being used. There's also a far simpler and cheaper form of preventing the pathogens from spreading. Fern finds out how the NHS is fighting the war against superbugs though cleaning and gets a crash course from head nurse Shona Perkins on how they keep the hospital clean.","small":"Fern Britton retraces the story of how the NHS saved her life after a sepsis diagnosis.","medium":"Fern Britton returns to Stoke Mandeville Hospital to retrace the dramatic story of how the NHS saved her life after she was diagnosed with sepsis.","editorial":"At Stoke Mandeville, Fern Britton retraces the story of how the NHS saved her life."},"versions":[{"hd":false,"id":"b0bbpj9j","kind":"original","type":"version","download":true,"duration":{"text":"44 mins","value":"PT43M46.800S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-08-15T09:00:00Z","start":"2018-07-16T09:00:00Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 29 days"}},"first_broadcast":"9:15am 16 Jul 2018"},{"hd":false,"id":"p06dwh7p","kind":"audio-described","type":"version","download":false,"duration":{"text":"44 mins","value":"PT43M46.680S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-08-15T09:00:00Z","start":"2018-07-16T09:40:57Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 29 days"}},"first_broadcast":"16 Jul 2018"}],"parent_id":"b0bbthc2","suppliers":[],"tleo_type":"brand","categories":["audio-described","documentaries","lifestyle"],"has_credits":true,"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_one","titles":{"large":"BBC One","small":"BBC One","medium":"BBC One"},"ident_id":"p04y9kr4","attribution":"bbc_one"},"release_date":"16 Jul 2018","related_links":[],"next_broadcast":{"channel_title":"BBC Two","scheduled_start":"2018-07-17T05:30:00.000Z"},"original_title":"Fern Britton","audio_described":true,"parent_position":1,"requires_sign_in":true,"release_date_time":"2018-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","editorial_subtitle":"1/5 Celebrity patients on how the NHS changed their lives","lexical_sort_letter":"M","requires_tv_licence":true,"promoted":true},{"id":"b0b8lfjh","live":false,"type":"episode","title":"Reporting Trump's First Year: The Fourth Estate","images":{"type":"image","standard":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06bf2kk.jpg"},"labels":{"category":"Documentary"},"signed":false,"status":"available","tleo_id":"b0b8lfhc","guidance":true,"subtitle":"Series 1: 1.

Attracting 35,000 visitors, the majority in costume, the Porthcawl Elvis Festival is the biggest Elvis festival in the world!\n\n'It's like an annual portal to a lateral universe,' says festival organiser Peter Phillips, 'And it's a universe that's probably quite fun to live in actually.'\n\nFast becoming a Welsh institution, it's a festival like no other - but not for the reasons that at first seems obvious. In this colourful film we meet the people who like to lose themselves as Elvis, or who like to lose themselves through watching make-believe Elvises, and we explore why the lure of Elvis is still so intoxicating 40 years on from his death.\n\nAmongst the rocking relics, revellers and devotees that pack the promenade, pubs and seafront pavilion, we meet festival opener Darren Graceland Jones, a full-time Elvis tribute artist whose bread and butter is performing as Elvis to dementia sufferers in care homes. He reveals the release that taking on the Elvis persona gives him in living with his own mental health issues. \n\nWe meet Becky Davis, the eternal party animal who sees the festival as her respite from being the full-time carer of her severely disabled son.\n\nMerthyr's own Juan Lozano, a festival favourite, is 'the godfather of Elvis tributes.' He talks about the beguiling bubble afforded by wearing the mask of Elvis.\n\nGordon Davis made his festival debut in 2009 and, despite his English-sounding name, comes from Malta. The fans' favourite, and star of the all-new Classic Elvis Orchestra Show premiering at the 2017 festival, he confesses that he doesn't even listen to Elvis at home and to him it's his job.\n\nBringing them all together is charismatic festival organiser Peter Phillips, on the face of it masterminding a festival to pull in the crowds, who recognises the social need that the festival fulfils in providing a sense of belonging to those 'outside of the box' who find acceptance, friendship and inclusivity within.","small":"Documentary looking at Porthcawl Elvis Festival, the largest Elvis festival in the world.","medium":"Documentary looking at Porthcawl Elvis Festival, the largest Elvis festival in the world, and exploring why the lure of Elvis is still so intoxicating 40 years on from his death.","editorial":"The King is alive and partying in Porthcawl – home of the world’s biggest Elvis festival."},"versions":[{"hd":false,"id":"b0b737ks","kind":"original","type":"version","download":true,"duration":{"text":"29 mins","value":"PT29M14.400S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-07-20T19:00:00Z","start":"2018-06-20T19:00:00Z","remaining":{"text":"Available until Fri 8pm"}},"credits_start":1737,"first_broadcast":"7:30pm 20 Jun 2018"},{"hd":false,"id":"p06bnqtm","kind":"audio-described","type":"version","download":false,"duration":{"text":"29 mins","value":"PT29M13.360S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-07-20T19:00:00Z","start":"2018-06-20T19:35:41Z","remaining":{"text":"Available until Fri 8pm"}},"first_broadcast":"20 Jun 2018"},{"hd":false,"id":"b0bb2hqp","kind":"signed","type":"version","download":true,"duration":{"text":"29 mins","value":"PT29M14.400S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-08-09T08:15:00Z","start":"2018-07-10T08:15:00Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 23 days"}},"first_broadcast":"20 Jun 2018"}],"suppliers":[],"tleo_type":"episode","categories":["audio-described","documentaries","signed"],"has_credits":true,"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_one","titles":{"large":"BBC One","small":"BBC One","medium":"BBC One"},"ident_id":"p04y9kr4","attribution":"bbc_one"},"release_date":"20 Jun 2018","related_links":[],"original_title":"Mad About Elvis","audio_described":true,"requires_sign_in":true,"release_date_time":"2018-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","editorial_subtitle":"Why is the lure of Elvis so intoxicating, 40 years on?","lexical_sort_letter":"M","requires_tv_licence":true},{"id":"b0b6q36l","live":false,"type":"episode","title":"Fight Like a Girl","images":{"type":"image","standard":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p069j26s.jpg"},"labels":{"category":"Sport"},"signed":true,"status":"available","tleo_id":"b0b6q36l","guidance":false,"synopses":{"large":"Kimberly Benson is Viper, one of Scotland's top female wrestlers.

Reggie also meets the non-Russians who live in fear of persecution and hears horrific stories of those who have survived vicious racist attacks.\n \nAnd with the rise of the far right not just in Russia but across many other western countries, including the UK, Reggie asks if this is what can happen when you love your country too much.","small":"Reggie Yates travels to Moscow to meet some of Russia's far right nationalists.","medium":"In the first of three programmes revealing the extreme side of Russia, Reggie Yates visits Moscow to get up close and personal with some of the country's far right nationalists."},"versions":[{"hd":false,"id":"p06655c6","kind":"original","type":"version","download":true,"duration":{"text":"57 mins","value":"PT57M14S"},"guidance":{"id":"D2L2","text":{"large":"Contains strong language and scenes which some viewers may find upsetting.","small":"Has guidance","medium":"Contains strong language and upsetting scenes."}},"availability":{"end":"2018-09-02T07:00:00Z","start":"2018-05-05T07:00:00Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 1 month"}},"first_broadcast":"13 Apr 2015"}],"parent_id":"b05rbyhq","suppliers":[],"tleo_type":"brand","categories":["documentaries"],"has_credits":true,"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_three","titles":{"large":"BBC Three","small":"BBC Three","medium":"BBC Three"},"ident_id":"p03bhqhy","attribution":"bbc_three"},"release_date":"13 Apr 2015","related_links":[{"id":"p02p8k84","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4vxbnRYC90RJsg7rZd0tmP/reggies-travel-bites","kind":"priority_content","type":"link","title":"Reggie's Travel Bites"}],"original_title":"Far Right & Proud","audio_described":false,"parent_position":1,"requires_sign_in":true,"release_date_time":"2015-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","lexical_sort_letter":"R","requires_tv_licence":true,"promoted":true},{"id":"b0b95q49","live":false,"type":"episode","title":"Strokes of Genius: Federer v Nadal","images":{"type":"image","standard":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06ctqs8.jpg"},"labels":{"category":"Sport"},"signed":false,"status":"available","tleo_id":"b0b95q49","guidance":false,"synopses":{"large":"Documentary looking back at the 2008 Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, widely acknowledged as one of the greatest matches of all time.\n\nThe programme uses archive footage to tell the story of both men from their childhood years to becoming the best two players in the world, with Nadal the King of Clay and Federer the master of the Wimbledon grass.\n\nBoth players describe their emotions throughout the remarkable contest that lasted nearly five hours, and there are also contributions from tennis legends such as John McEnroe, Bjorn Borg, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova.","small":"Looking back at the 2008 Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.","medium":"Documentary looking back at the 2008 Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, widely acknowledged as one of the greatest matches of all time.","editorial":"The inside and unseen story of the epic 2008 showdown between the two tennis legends."},"versions":[{"hd":false,"id":"b0b95q0r","kind":"original","type":"version","download":true,"duration":{"text":"98 mins","value":"PT1H37M43S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-08-07T19:00:00Z","start":"2018-07-08T19:00:00Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 22 days"}},"first_broadcast":"30 Jun 2018"}],"suppliers":[],"tleo_type":"episode","categories":["documentaries-life-stories","documentaries","sport"],"has_credits":true,"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_two","titles":{"large":"BBC Two","small":"BBC Two","medium":"BBC Two"},"ident_id":"p0393z1f","attribution":"bbc_two"},"release_date":"30 Jun 2018","related_links":[],"original_title":"Strokes of Genius: Federer v Nadal","audio_described":false,"requires_sign_in":true,"release_date_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","editorial_subtitle":"The greatest match of all time","lexical_sort_letter":"S","requires_tv_licence":true,"promoted":true},{"id":"p06bg79g","type":"group_large","group_type":"curated","images":{"type":"image","standard":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06bg7rq.jpg","vertical":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06bt9xv.jpg"},"episode_sort_direction":"asc","stacked":false,"related_links":[],"title":"NHS at 70","synopses":{"small":"A series of programmes spotlighting the pioneering work of NHS hospitals"},"count":15,"initial_children":[{"id":"b0b98vsg","live":false,"type":"episode","title":"Critical: Inside Intensive Care","images":{"type":"image","standard":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06dg1dy.jpg"},"labels":{"category":"Documentary"},"signed":false,"status":"available","tleo_id":"b0b98vsg","guidance":false,"synopses":{"large":"Critical or intensive care departments look after the sickest people in Wales and attempt to bring them back from the brink.

In 2016 whilst recovering at home from surgery, Fern was suddenly rushed into hospital and diagnosed with E coli and sepsis. She was immediately brought into emergency surgery that ultimately saved her life.\n\nIt is estimated that around 200,000 people a year in the UK get sepsis, and of those, up to 60,000 die. Many of these cases are avoidable, but sepsis is notoriously difficult to diagnose. It was only through the quick-thinking actions of the NHS staff, and the rapid diagnosis of her blood samples, that Fern survived. She returns to the hospital to meet the surgeon who operated on her and the consultant who diagnosed her, to say thank you and find out more about the condition that nearly killed her.\n\nWhen Fern came in, her samples were sent to the pathology lab for analysis. Fern visits one of the NHS's busiest pathology labs, which processes 70,000 samples a day, to find out how it works and what has changed over the years. \n\nThe NHS has been waging a war against infectious disease since it started 70 years ago, but sophisticated medicine and vaccinations aren't the only weapons being used. There's also a far simpler and cheaper form of preventing the pathogens from spreading. Fern finds out how the NHS is fighting the war against superbugs though cleaning and gets a crash course from head nurse Shona Perkins on how they keep the hospital clean.","small":"Fern Britton retraces the story of how the NHS saved her life after a sepsis diagnosis.","medium":"Fern Britton returns to Stoke Mandeville Hospital to retrace the dramatic story of how the NHS saved her life after she was diagnosed with sepsis.","editorial":"At Stoke Mandeville, Fern Britton retraces the story of how the NHS saved her life."},"versions":[{"hd":false,"id":"b0bbpj9j","kind":"original","type":"version","download":true,"duration":{"text":"44 mins","value":"PT43M46.800S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-08-15T09:00:00Z","start":"2018-07-16T09:00:00Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 29 days"}},"first_broadcast":"9:15am 16 Jul 2018"},{"hd":false,"id":"p06dwh7p","kind":"audio-described","type":"version","download":false,"duration":{"text":"44 mins","value":"PT43M46.680S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-08-15T09:00:00Z","start":"2018-07-16T09:40:57Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 29 days"}},"first_broadcast":"16 Jul 2018"}],"parent_id":"b0bbthc2","suppliers":[],"tleo_type":"brand","categories":["audio-described","documentaries","lifestyle"],"has_credits":true,"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_one","titles":{"large":"BBC One","small":"BBC One","medium":"BBC One"},"ident_id":"p04y9kr4","attribution":"bbc_one"},"release_date":"16 Jul 2018","related_links":[],"next_broadcast":{"channel_title":"BBC Two","scheduled_start":"2018-07-17T05:30:00.000Z"},"original_title":"Fern Britton","audio_described":true,"parent_position":1,"requires_sign_in":true,"release_date_time":"2018-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","editorial_subtitle":"1/5 Celebrity patients on how the NHS changed their lives","lexical_sort_letter":"M","requires_tv_licence":true},{"id":"b0b8lxs3","live":false,"type":"episode","title":"Celebrities on the NHS Frontline","images":{"type":"image","standard":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06c2fsr.jpg"},"labels":{"category":"Documentary"},"signed":true,"status":"available","tleo_id":"b0b8slyk","guidance":false,"subtitle":"Series 1: Episode 1","synopses":{"large":"At King's College Hospital, reporter Stacey Dooley, Paralympic gold medallist Jonnie Peacock, ex-politician Ann Widdecombe and medical journalist Michael Mosley work alongside hospital staff to find out, from the people who know the NHS best, just what it takes to keep the nation alive.\n\nIn the first episode Stacey works as a healthcare assistant, changing beds and cleaning bed pans on the liver ward, as she explores how lifestyle illnesses impact the NHS.

Israel","synopses":{"large":"Piers Taylor and Caroline Quentin are in Israel, where exciting modern houses are inspired by rich cultural and historical traditions. J-House is in Herzliya, a millionaire's playground by the Med. It is a palatial white home tucked away in a suburban plot and reached by a bridge over lush gardens. Piers and Caroline discover luxurious, warm and vibrant interiors that contrast with the modernist facade. Glass walls open up to connect the entire living area with the gardens and pool.\n\nShutter House sits on a hillside overlooking the Sea of Galilee. It is an elegant, unshowy house, and its subtle colours and materials match the soil and stone of the olive and carob groves. To combat the 40-degree heat, the architects used a traditional system of balconies, breezeways and beautiful wooden screens, which cast light and shadows throughout this peaceful house. Caroline says being here is 'a religious experience.' \n\nPiers and Caroline's next destination is the historic city of Jerusalem. Barud House is a love poem to Jerusalem stone - named after the warning cry given by quarry workers before detonating explosives. Its facade is made from 50,000 white stone tiles, arranged into a symmetrical pattern that casts shadows across the house all day. Inside Piers and Caroline discover more stone - the rough rock face behind the house has been left exposed and is boldly revealed behind a glass wall. Gleaming white interiors, a swimming pool, games room and big city views enhance the glamour of this striking house.\n\nThe final stop is the Arab village of Musmus and the House of Three Gardens. Tel Aviv architect Ron Fleisher has designed a house that combines traditional Islamic architecture with modernism. He has linked existing buildings with a stunning double-height traditional liwan, or entrance hall, and a gleaming white staircase. Ron also designed a light, spacious drawing room and created three beautiful themed gardens to honour the family's farming history.","small":"Piers and Caroline are in Israel, where modern houses are inspired by rich traditions.","medium":"Piers Taylor and Caroline Quentin are in Israel, where exciting modern houses are inspired by rich cultural and historical traditions."},"versions":[{"hd":false,"id":"b0b8l8b8","kind":"original","type":"version","download":true,"duration":{"text":"59 mins","value":"PT58M31.160S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-07-30T16:25:00Z","start":"2018-06-27T20:00:00Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 14 days"}},"credits_start":3485,"first_broadcast":"8pm 27 Jun 2018"},{"hd":false,"id":"p06c842c","kind":"audio-described","type":"version","download":false,"duration":{"text":"59 mins","value":"PT58M31.440S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-07-30T16:25:00Z","start":"2018-06-27T21:07:37Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 14 days"}},"first_broadcast":"27 Jun 2018"},{"hd":false,"id":"b0bb2jrn","kind":"signed","type":"version","download":true,"duration":{"text":"59 mins","value":"PT58M31.120S"},"availability":{"end":"2018-08-10T00:10:00Z","start":"2018-07-11T00:10:00Z","remaining":{"text":"Available for 24 days"}},"first_broadcast":"27 Jun 2018"}],"parent_id":"b09tqygd","suppliers":[],"tleo_type":"brand","categories":["audio-described","documentaries","lifestyle","signed"],"has_credits":true,"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_two","titles":{"large":"BBC Two","small":"BBC Two","medium":"BBC Two"},"ident_id":"p0393z1f","attribution":"bbc_two"},"release_date":"27 Jun 2018","related_links":[],"original_title":"Israel","audio_described":true,"parent_position":8,"requires_sign_in":true,"release_date_time":"2018-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","editorial_subtitle":"Inspiration in Israel","lexical_sort_letter":"W","requires_tv_licence":true,"promoted":true},{"id":"b09c9xbn","live":false,"type":"episode","title":"Our World","images":{"type":"image","standard":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p05k3k4v.jpg"},"labels":{"category":"Documentary"},"signed":false,"status":"available","tleo_id":"b0070w71","guidance":false,"subtitle":"Songbirds for Sale","synopses":{"large":"The songbird trade in Indonesia is booming, causing dozens of protected species to be threatened with extinction.
